# French to English Translator using Deep Learning

<p>This project aims to build a French to English translator using an artificial Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).</p>

## Data

<p>The data comes from a .txt file containing more than 160000 sentences with their translation separated by a tab (`\t`).

It can be found on this link: https://go.aws/38ECHUB .

For performance purposes, we will not be working on the whole dataset but on a sample of 5000 sentences instead. This will allow faster iterations and avoid bugs related to our need for computer power.</p>
